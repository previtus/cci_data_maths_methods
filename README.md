### Course Description:

This module introduces fundamental mathematical and numerical concepts required for the development of algorithmic and computational approaches in Creative Computing. Students develop their knowledge of Calculus, Geometry and Algebra through applied, practical programming tasks.

* Numeral systems and types (binary, decimal, octal, hexadecimal; integer,
float, double, long).
* Operators (binary operations, logical operations, arithmetic operations,
bitwise operations), conditionals and loops.
* Trigonometry (sin, cos, tan, arctan, powers, roots, logarithms etc.).
* Arrays, vectors, matrices and transformations.

### Language: 
* TBA
* Python 3.0+ 

### Software:  
* TBA

#### Essential Reading 

* Generative Design: Visualize, Program, and Create with Processing. Hartmut Bohnacker, Benedikt Gross, Julia Laub, Claudius Lazzeroni (2012).

* Learning Processing. Daniel Shiffman Morgan Kaufman (2008)

* Processing. Casey Reas and Ben Fry. MIT Press (2007)

#### Further Reading 

#### Grading: 

* Multiple Choice test: Students will be presented with a series of questions relating explicitly to course content. They must choose between up to 4 potential correct answers per question. (50%)

* Practical Exam: Students will be individually asked to write a basic program to solve a simple mathematical problem. They must use only basic operators and simple functions learned in class. (50%)
